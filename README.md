# JSON-Data-Analysis-in-Python

### Data Analysis - Fetch Rewards Coding Exercise 
In this project we will demonstrate how to understand data and relate one data set to other to answer predetermine bussiness question.

There are various methods we load the data into database:


###### 1- Traditional way of uploading data into database using Python 
###### 2- Writing SQL dialect patriculay related to the RBMS in used in my case PostgreSQL.
(Data-Analysis-Using-PostgreSQL-Dialects https://github.com/mushahidmehdi/Data-Analysis-Using-PostgreSQL-dialects in this repo we will perform exactly same task but using PostgreSQL-Dialects)


## In This Project we will use Python function to create a RDBMS 

### STEPS:

1- Review unstructure json data and build a new structure relational data base in PostgreSQL using Postgres Dilects.                                                 
2- Generate query to answer predetermine bussiness question.                                                                                          
3- Write a short Email to bussiness stack holder about predertmined questions.                                                                                         

We have three different json data.
